# Python
Python is originally an extensible version of a Dutch teaching language called ABC, with exceptions added from Modula-3. Python, in contrast to ABC, could also access the file system and operating system so it could be used instead of shell scripts.
When Python came out, your options to start programming were either boring BASIC or paying for a compiled language, and also the internet was just starting to bloom. Python had a receptive audience of young budding programmers and gave rise to the first "script kiddie" generation. Python is now unreasonably popular for Machine Learning and has climbed to the top of the Tiobe language ranking.

Python's most unfortunate feature is the significant whitespace, which means programs can be invisibly broken. This got Google to lose some of its enthusiasm for Python. It is also slow, and devOps teams that previously used Python have mainly moved on to Go. Also, despite YouTube being mainly powered by Python, it is gruesome work maintaining a large Python project, you probably don't want to go there.

The fact remains that Python is very much loved by very many people, and used a lot, so it's probably worth knowing a bit about it. And for small programs it is said to be a delight to use.

Python may already be installed on your computer, but if not, and you want to run locally, you need to [get it](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How to run the tests

```bash
python aoc_test.py
```

### How to build and run
```bash
part=part1 python aoc.py
```

You can also start an interactive session by just typing `python` on the command line in the terminal.
